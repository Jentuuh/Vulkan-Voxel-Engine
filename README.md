# Vulkan-Voxel-Engine
A personal experiment in which I develop an open world voxel engine using C++ and the Vulkan API.

## Dependencies
To be able to compile and run the project, you will need these dependencies. After downloading them, make sure you add the necessary include directories (containing the library's header files) and library directories (containing the static `.lib` and/or dynamic library `.dll` files, this is not necessary for header-only libraries) to your project configuration so the compiler and linker know where to find these.
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) (3.3.4)
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
